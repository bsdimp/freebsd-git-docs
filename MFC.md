# How to MFC

** NOTE: THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS and current woefully incomplete **

Note: This document uses the convention where the upstream origin name
is `freebsd` as suggested in other docs.

## Goals

When committing source commits to stable and releng branches, we have
the following goals:

1. Clearly mark direct commits distinct from commits that merge a
   change from another branch
2. Avoid introducing known breakage into stable and releng branches
3. Allow developers to determine which changes have or have not been
   merged from one branch to another

With subversion, we used the following practices to achieve these goals:

1. Using 'MFC' and 'MFS' tags to mark commits that merged changes from
   another branch
2. Squashing fixup commits into the main commit when merging a change
3. Recording mergeinfo so that `svn mergeinfo --show-revs` worked

With Git, we will need to use different strategies to achieve the same
goals.  This document aims to define best practices when merging
source commits using git that achieve these goals.  In general, we aim
to use git's native support to achieve these goals rather than
enforcing practices built on subversion's model.

One general note: due to technical differences with Git, we will not
be using git "merge commits" (created via `git merge`) in stable or
releng branches.  Instead, when this document refers to "merge
commits", it means a commit originally made to `main` that is
replicated to a stable branch, or a commit from a stable branch that
is replicated to a releng branch with some varation of `git
cherry-pick`.

## Commit message standards

### Marking Merges

There are two main options for marking merges as distinct from direct
commits:

1. One option that matches our existing practice (the wisdom of which
   I'm not commenting on) would mark MFCs like this in the commit
   message:

```
MFC: 12def6789a,ac32ee4a5c
```

   where the first 10 digits of the hash (might be longer in a large repository)
   is used to mark the commit message. This "abbreviated hash" can be retrieved by:

```
git show --format=%p --no-patch $full_hash
```

   This preserves the information, but isn't 'git standard'.  It also
   requires committers to manually edit commit messages to include
   this information when merging.

2. Use the `-x` flag with `git cherry-pick`.  This adds a line to the
   commit message that includes the hash of the original commit when
   merging.  Since it is added by Git directly, committers do not have
   to manually edit the commit log when merging.

We feel that the second option is simpler going forward.

### Finding Eligible Merges

Git provides some built-in support for this via the `git cherry` and
`git log --cherry` commands.  These commands compare the raw diffs of
commits (but not other metadata such as log messages) to determine if
two commits are identical.  This works well when each commit from head
is merged as a single commit to a stable branch, but it falls over if
multiple commits from main are squashed together as a single commit to
a stable branch.

There are a few options for resolving this:

1. We could ban squashing of commits and instead require that committers
   stage all of the fixup / follow-up commits to stable into a single
   push.  This would still achieve the goal of stability in stable and
   releng branches since pushes are atomic and users doing a simple pull
   will never end up with a tree that has the main commit without the
   fixup(s).  `git bisect` is also able to cope with this model via
   `git bisect skip`.

2. We could adopt a consistent style for describing merges and write
   our own tooling to wrap around `git cherry` to determine the list
   of eligible commits.  A simple approach here might be to use the
   syntax from `git cherry-pick -x`, but require that a squashed
   commit list all of the hashes (one line per hash) at the end of
   the commit message.  Developers could do this by using
   `git cherry-pick -x` of each individual commit into a branch and
   then use `git rebase` to squash the commits down into a single
   commit, but collecting the `-x` annotations at the end of the
   merged commit log.

### Trim Metadata?

One area that was not clearly documented with subversion (or even CVS)
is how to format metadata in log messages for merge commits.  Should
it include the metadata from the original commit unchanged, or should
it be altered to reflect information about the merge commit itself?

Historical practice has varied, though some of the variance is by
field.  For example, merges that are relevant to a PR generally
include the PR field in the merge so that merge commits are included
in the bug tracker's audit trail.  Other fields are less clear.  For
example, Phabricator shows the diff of the last commit tagged to a
review, so including Phabricator URLs replaces the `main` commit with
the merged commits.  The list of reviewers is also not clear.  If a
reviewer has approved a change to `main`, does that mean they have
approved the merge commit?  What it the merge encounters conflicts, or
if the commit doesn't conflict but introduces an ABI change?  A
reviewer may have ok'd a commit for `main` due to the ABI breakage but
may not approve of merging the same commit as-is.

For merges regulated by re@, new metadata fields are added, such as
the Approved by tag for approved commits.  This new metadata will have
to be added via `git commit --amend` or similar after the original
commit has been reviewed and approved.  We may also want to reserve
some metadata fields in merge commits such as Phabricator URLs for use
by re@ in the future.

Preserving existing metadata provides a very simple workflow.
Developers can just use `git cherry-pick -x` without having to edit
the log message.

If instead we choose to adjust metadata in merges, developers will
have to edit log messages explicitly via the use of `git cherry-pick
--edit` or `git commit --amend`.  However, as compared to svn, at
least the existing commit message can be pre-populated and metadata
fields can be added or removed without having to re-enter the entire
commit message.

## Single commit MFC

```
% git checkout stable/X
% git cherry-pick -x $HASH --edit
```

For merge commits, for example a vendor import, you would need to specify one parent for cherry-pick
purposes.  Normally, that would be the "first parent" of the branch you are cherry-picking from, so:

```
% git checkout stable/X
% git cherry-pick -x $HASH -m 1 --edit
```

If things go wrong, you'll either need to abort the cherry-pick with `git cherry-pick --abort` or fix it
up and do a `git cherry-pick --continue`.

Once the cherry-pick is finished, push with `git push`.  If you get an error due to losing the commit race,
use `git pull --rebase` and try to push again.

## Multiple commit MFC

```
% git checkout -b tmp-branch stable/X
% for h in $HASH_LIST; do git cherry-pick -x $h; done
% git rebase -i stable/X
# mark each of the commits after the first as 'squash'
# edit the commit message to be sane
% git push freebsd HEAD:stable/X
```

If the push fails due to losing the commit race, rebase and try again:

```
% git checkout stable/X
% git pull
% git checkout tmp-branch
% git rebase stable/X
% git push freebsd HEAD:stable/X
```

Once the merge is complete, you can delete the temporary branch:

```
% git checkout stable/X
% git branch -d tmp-branch
```

## Looking for things to MFC

If you are looking for changes to MFC, the following may help:
```
% git log --cherry stable/12 main -- bin/ls
```

## Scripts

We currently have no scripts.

## Examples

### Merging a Single Subversion Commit

This walks through the process of merging a commit to stable/12 that
was originally committed to head in Subversion.  In this case, the
original commit is r368685.

The first step is to map the Subversion commit to a Git hash.  Once
you have fetched refs/notes/commits, you can pass the revision number
to `git log --grep`:

```
> git log main --grep 368685
commit ce8395ecfda2c8e332a2adf9a9432c2e7f35ea81
Author: John Baldwin <jhb@FreeBSD.org>

    Sponsored by:   DARPA
    Differential Revision:  https://reviews.freebsd.org/D27576

Notes:
    svn path=/head/; revision=368685
```

Next, merge the commit to a `stable/12` checkout:

```
git checkout stable/12
git cherry-pick -x ce8395ecfda2c8e332a2adf9a9432c2e7f35ea81 --edit
```

Git will invoke the editor.  Use this to remove the metadata that only
applied to the original commit (Phabricator URL and Reviewed by).
After the editor saves the updated log message, Git completes the
commit:

```
[stable/12 3e3a548c4874] Use the 't' modifier to print a ptrdiff_t.
 Date: Wed Dec 16 00:11:30 2020 +0000
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

The contents of the merged commit can be examined via `git show`:

```

### Merging a Single Subversion Commit with a Conflict

This example is similar to the previous example except that the
commit in question encounters a merge conflict.  In this case, the
original commit is r368314.

As above, the first step is to map the Subversion commit to a Git
hash:

```
> git log main --grep 368314
commit 99963f5343a017e934e4d8ea2371a86789a46ff9

Next, merge the commit to a `stable/12` checkout:

```
git checkout stable/12
git cherry-pick -x 99963f5343a017e934e4d8ea2371a86789a46ff9 --edit
Auto-merging sys/dev/cxgbe/tom/t4_cpl_io.c

hint: after resolving the conflicts, mark the corrected paths
hint: with 'git add <paths>' or 'git rm <paths>'
hint: and commit the result with 'git commit'
```

In this case, the commit encountered a merge conflict in
sys/dev/cxge/tom/t4_cpl_io.c as kernel TLS is not present in
stable/12.  Note that Git does not invoke an editor to adjust the
commit message due to the conflict.  `git status` confirms that this
file has merge conflicts:

```
> git status
On branch stable/12
Your branch is up to date with 'upstream/stable/12'.

You are currently cherry-picking commit 99963f5343a0.
  (fix conflicts and run "git cherry-pick --continue")
  (use "git cherry-pick --skip" to skip this patch)
  (use "git cherry-pick --abort" to cancel the cherry-pick operation)

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
        both modified:   sys/dev/cxgbe/tom/t4_cpl_io.c

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

After editing the file to resolve the conflict, `git status` shows the
conflict as resolved:

```
> git status
On branch stable/12
Your branch is up to date with 'upstream/stable/12'.

You are currently cherry-picking commit 99963f5343a0.
  (all conflicts fixed: run "git cherry-pick --continue")
  (use "git cherry-pick --skip" to skip this patch)
  (use "git cherry-pick --abort" to cancel the cherry-pick operation)

Changes to be committed:
        modified:   sys/dev/cxgbe/tom/t4_cpl_io.c
```

The cherry-pick can now be completed:

```
> git cherry-pick --continue
```

Since there was a merge conflict, Git invokes the editor to
adjust the commit message.  Trim the metadata fields from the
commit log from the original commit to head and save the
updated log message.

The contents of the merged commit can be examined via `git show`:
