# FreeBSD mini-git Primer

## Scope
If you want to download FreeBSD, compile it from sources and generally
keep up to date that way, this primer is for you. If you are looking
to do more with the tree, contribute back, or commit changes, then you
should look HERE(link to developers guide). It covers getting the
sources, updating the sources, how to bisect and touches briefly on
how to cope with a few local changes. It covers the basics, and tries
to give good pointers to more in-depth treatment for when the readers
finds the basics insufficient.

The goal of this document is to highlight those bits of git needed to
track sources. They assume a basic understanding of git. There are
many primers for git on the web, but the [Git
Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) provides one of the better
treatments.

## Keeping Current With FreeBSD src tree
First step: cloning a tree. This downloads the entire tree. There are
two ways to download. Most people will want to do a deep clone of the
repo. However, there are times that you may wish to do a shallow
clone.

### Branch names
The branch names in the new git repo are similar to the old names. For
the stable branches, they are stable/X where X is the major release
(like 11 or 12). The main branch in the new repo is 'main'. The main
branch in the old GitHub mirror is 'master'. Both reflect the
defaults of git at the time they were created. The main/master branch
is the default branch if you omit the '-b branch' or '--branch branch'
options below.

### Repositories
Please see [URLs.md] for the latest information on where to get FreeBSD soruces.
$URL below can be obstained from that page.

Note: The project doesn't use submodules as they are a poor fit for our workflows and development model.
How we track changes in third-party applications is discussed elsewhere and generally of little concern to the casual user.

### Deep Clone
A deep clone pulls in the entire tree, as well as all the history and
branches. It's the easiest to do. It also allows you to use git's
worktree feature to have all your active branches checked out into
separate directories but with only one copy of the repository.
```
% git clone -o freebsd $URL -b branch [dir]
```
is how you make a deep clone. 'branch' should be one of the branches
listed in the previous section. It is optional if it is the
main/master branch. dir is an optional directory to place it in (the
default will be the name of the repo you are cloning (freebsd or src)).

You'll want a deep clone if you are interested in the history, plan on
making local changes, or plan on working on more than one branch. It's
the easiest to keep up to date as well. If you are interested in the
history, but are working with only one branch and are short on space,
you can also use --single-branch to only download the one branch
(though some merge commits will not reference the merged-from branch
which may be important for some users who are interested in detailed
versions of history).

### Shallow Clone

A shallow clone copies just the most current code, but none or little of the history.
This can be useful when you need to build a specific revision of FreeBSD, or when you are just starting out and plan to track the tree more fully.
You can also use it to limit history to only so many revisions.
However, see below for a significant limitation of this approach.

```
% git clone -o freebsd -b branch --depth 1 $URL [dir]
```

This clones the repository, but only has the most recent version in the repository.
The rest of the history is not downloaded.
Should you change your mind later, you can do 'git fetch --unshallow' to get the old history.

WARNING: When you make a shallow clone, you will lose the commit count in your uname output.
This can make it more difficult to determine if your system needs to be updated when a security advisory is issued.

### Building

Once you've downloaded, building is done as described in the handbook,
eg:
```
% cd src
% make buildworld
% make buildkernel
% make installkernel
% make installworld
```
so that won't be covered in depth here.

If you want to build a custom kernel, chapter 8.4 of the FreeBSD
Handbook recommends creating a file MYKERNEL under sys/${ARCH}/conf
with your changes against GENERIC. To have MYKERNEL disregarded by
git, it can be added to .git/info/exclude.

### Updating

To update both types of trees uses the same commands. This pulls in
all the revisions since your last update.
```
% git pull --ff-only
```
will update the tree. In git, a 'fast forward' merge is one that only
needs to set a new branch pointer and doesn't need to re-create the
commits. By always doing a 'fast forward' merge/pull, you'll ensure
that you have an identical copy of the FreeBSD tree. This will be
important if you want to maintain local patches.

See below for how to manage local changes. The simplest is to use
--autostash on the 'git pull' command, but more sophisticated options
are available.

## Selecting a Specific Version

In git, the 'git checkout' checks out both branches and specific
versions.  Git's versions are the long hashes rather than a sequential
number.

When you checkout a specific version, just specify the hash you want
on the command line (the git log command can help you decide which
hash you might want):
```
% git checkout 08b8197a74
```
and you have that checked out. You'll be greeted with a message
similar to the following:
```
Note: checking out '08b8197a742a96964d2924391bf9fdfeb788865d'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

HEAD is now at 08b8197a742a hook gpiokeys.4 to the build
```
where the last line is generated from the hash you are checking out
and the first line of the commit message from that revision.  The hash
can be abbreviated to the shortest unique length. Git itself is
inconsistent about how many digits it displays.

## Bisecting
Sometimes, things go wrong. The last version worked, but the one you
just updated to does not. A developer may ask to bisect the problem to
track down which commit caused the regression.

If you've read the last section, you may be thinking to yourself "How
the heck do I bisect with crazy version numbers like that?" then this
section is for you. It's also for you if you didn't think that, but
also want to bisect.

Fortunately, one uses the 'git bisect' command. Here's a brief outline
in how to use it. For more information, I'd suggest
https://www.metaltoad.com/blog/beginners-guide-git-bisect-process-elimination
or https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect for more details. The man page
is good at describing what can go wrong, what to do when versions
won't build, when you want to use terms other than 'good' and 'bad',
etc, none of which will be covered here.

`git bisect start` will start the bisection process. Next, you need to
tell a range to go through. 'git bisect good XXXXXX' will tell it the
working version and 'git bisect bad XXXXX' will tell it the bad
version. The bad version will almost always be HEAD (a special tag for
what you have checked out). The good version will be the last one you
checked out.

A quick aside: if you want to know the last version you checked out,
you should use 'git reflog':
```
5ef0bd68b515 (HEAD -> master, freebsd/master, freebsd/HEAD) HEAD@{0}: pull --ff-only: Fast-forward
a8163e165c5b (upstream/master) HEAD@{1}: checkout: moving from b6fb97efb682994f59b21fe4efb3fcfc0e5b9eeb to master
...
```
shows me moving the working tree to the master branch (a816...) and
then updating from upstream (to 5ef0...). In this case, bad would be
HEAD (or 5rf0bd68) and good would be a8163e165. As you can see from
the output, HEAD@{1} also often works, but isn't foolproof if you've
done other things to your git tree after updating, but before you
discover the need to bisect.

Back to git bisect. Set the 'good' version first, then set the bad
(though the order doesn't matter). When you set the bad version, it
will give you some statistics on the process:
```
% git bisect start
% git bisect good a8163e165c5b
% git bisect bad HEAD
Bisecting: 1722 revisions left to test after this (roughly 11 steps)
[c427b3158fd8225f6afc09e7e6f62326f9e4de7e] Fixup r361997 by balancing parens.  Duh.
```

You'd then build/install that version. If it's good you'd type 'git
bisect good' otherwise 'git bisect bad'. If the version doesn't compile,
type 'git bisect skip'.  You'll get a similar message
to the above after each step. When you are done, report the bad version to
the developer (or fix the bug yourself and send a patch). 'git bisect
reset' will end the process and return you back to where you started
(usually tip of main). Again, the git-bisect manual (linked above) is
a good resource for when things go wrong or for unusual cases.

## Ports Considerations
The ports tree operates the same way. The branch names are different
and the repos are in different locations.

The legacy GitHub mirror is at https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-ports.git .
The canonical cgit mirror is https://cgit-beta.freebsd.org/ports.git . The
production git repo will be https://git.freebsd.org/ports.git and
ssh://anongit@git.FreeBSD.org/ports.git (or anongit@git.FreeBSD.org:ports.git)
when the time comes.

As with ports, the 'current' branches are 'master' (legacy) and 'main' (new)
respectively. The quarterly branches are named the same as in
FreeBSD's svn repo.

## Coping with Local Changes
This section addresses tracking local changes. If you have no local
changes, you can stop reading now (it's the last section and OK to
skip).

One item that's important for all of them: all changes are local until
pushed. Unlike svn, git uses a distributed model. For users, for most
things, there's very little difference. However, if you have local
changes, you can use the same tool to manage them as you use to pull
in changes from FreeBSD. All changes that you've not pushed are local
and can easily be modified (git rebase, discussed below does this).


### Keeping local changes
The simplest way to keep local changes (especially trivial ones) is to
use 'git stash'. In its simples form, you use 'git stash' to record
the changes (which pushes them onto the stash stack). Most people use
this to save changes before updating the tree as described above. They
then use 'git stash apply' to re-apply them to the tree. The stash is
a stack of changes that can be examined with 'git stash list'. The
git-stash man page (https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash) has all the
details.

This method is suitable when you have tiny tweaks to the tree. When
you have anything non trivial, you'll likely be better off keeping a
local branch and rebasing. Stashing is also integrated with the 'git
pull' command: just add '--autostash' to the command line.

### Keeping a local branch
It's much easier to keep a local branch with git than subversion. In
subversion you need to merge the commit, and resolve the
conflicts. This is manageable, but can lead to a convoluted history
that's hard to upstream should that ever be necessary, or hard to
replicate if you need to do so. Git also allows one to merge, along
with the same problems. That's one way to manage the branch, but it's
the least flexible.

In addition to merging, git supports the concept of 'rebasing' which
avoids these issues. The 'git rebase' command replays all the commits
of a branch at a newer location on the parent branch. We'll cover the
most common scenarios that arise using it.

#### Create a branch

Let's say you want to make a hack to FreeBSD's ls command to never,
ever do color. There are many reasons to do this, but this example will
use that as a baseline. The FreeBSD ls command changes from time to
time, and you'll need to cope with those changes. Fortunately, with
git rebase it usually is automatic.
```
% cd src
% git checkout main
% git checkout -b no-color-ls
% cd bin/ls
% vi ls.c     # hack the changes in
% git diff    # check the changes
diff --git a/bin/ls/ls.c b/bin/ls/ls.c
index 7378268867ef..cfc3f4342531 100644
--- a/bin/ls/ls.c
+++ b/bin/ls/ls.c
@@ -66,6 +66,7 @@ __FBSDID("$FreeBSD$");
 #include <stdlib.h>
 #include <string.h>
 #include <unistd.h>
+#undef COLORLS
 #ifdef COLORLS
 #include <termcap.h>
 #include <signal.h>
% # these look good, make the commit...
% git commit ls.c
```

The commit will pop you into an editor to describe what you've
done. Once you enter that, you have your own **local** branch in the
git repo. Build and install it like you normally would, following the
directions in the handbook. git differs from other version control
systems in that you have to tell it explicitly which files to
use. I've opted to do it on the commit command line, but you can also
do it with 'git add' which many of the more in depth tutorials cover.

#### Time to update
When it's time to bring in a new version, it's almost the same as w/o
the branches. You would update like you would above, but there's one
extra command before you update, and one after. The following assumes
you are starting with an unmodified tree. It's important to start
rebasing operations with a clean tree (git usually requires this).

```
% git checkout main
% git pull --no-ff
% git rebase -i main no-color-ls
```

This will bring up an editor that lists all the commits in it. For
this example, don't change it at all. This is typically what you are
doing while updating the baseline (though you also use the git rebase
command to curate the commits you have in the branch).

Once you're done with the above, you've move the commits to ls.c
forward from the old version of FreeBSD to the newer one.

Sometimes there's merge conflicts. That's OK. Don't panic. You'd
handle them the same as you would any other merge conflicts. To keep
it simple, I'll just describe a common issue you might see. A pointer
to a more complete treatment can be found at the end of this section.

Let's say the includes changes upstream in a radical shift to terminfo
as well as a name change for the option.  When you updated, you might
see something like this:
```
Auto-merging bin/ls/ls.c
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in bin/ls/ls.c
error: could not apply 646e0f9cda11... no color ls
Resolve all conflicts manually, mark them as resolved with
"git add/rm <conflicted_files>", then run "git rebase --continue".
You can instead skip this commit: run "git rebase --skip".
To abort and get back to the state before "git rebase", run "git rebase --abort".
Could not apply 646e0f9cda11... no color ls
```

which looks scary. If you bring up an editor, you'll see it's a
typical 3-way merge conflict resolution that you may be familiar with
from other source code systems (the rest of ls.c has been omitted):
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
#ifdef COLORLS_NEW
#include <terminfo.h>
=======
#undef COLORLS
#ifdef COLORLS
#include <termcap.h>
>>>>>>> 646e0f9cda11... no color ls
```
The new code is first, and your code is second. The right fix here is
to just add a #undef COLORLS_NEW before #ifdef and then delete the old
changes:
```
#undef COLORLS_NEW
#ifdef COLORLS_NEW
#include <terminfo.h>
```
save the file. The rebase was interrupted, so you have to complete it:
```
% git add ls.c
% git rebase --continue
```

which tells git that ls.c has been fixed and to continue the rebase
operation.  Since there was a conflict, you'll get kicked into the
editor to update the commit message if necessary. It the commit
message is still accurate, just exit the editor.

If you get stuck during the rebase, don't panic. git rebase --abort
will take you back to a clean slate. It's important, though, to start
with an unmodified tree.
An aside: The above mentioned 'git reflog' comes in handy here, as it will have
a list of all the (intermediate) commits that you can view or inspect or
cherry-pick.

For more on this topic,
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-ultimate-guide-to-git-merge-and-git-rebase/
provides a rather extensive treatment. It is a good resource for
issues that arise occasionally but are too obscure for this guide.

### Switching to a Different FreeBSD Branch
If you wish to shift from stable/12 to the current branch.
If you have a deep clone, the following will suffice:
```
% git checkout main
% # build and install here...
```
If you have a local branch, though, there's one or
two caveats. First, rebase will rewrite history, so you'll likely want
to do something to save it. Second, jumping branches tends to
encounter more conflicts. If we pretend the example above was relative
to stable/12, then to move to main, I'd suggest the following:
```
% git checkout no-color-ls
% git checkout -b no-color-ls-stable-12   # create another name for this branch
% git rebase -i stable/12 no-color-ls --onto main
```

What the above does is checkout no-color-ls. Then create a new name
for it (no-color-ls-stable-12) in case you need to get back to
it. Then you rebase onto the main branch. This will find all the
commits to the current no-color-ls branch (back to where it meets up
with the stable/12 branch) and then it will replay them onto the main
branch creating a new no-color-ls branch there (which is why I had you
create a place holder name).

### Migrating from an existing git clone
If you have work based on a previous git conversion or a locally
running git-svn conversion, migrating to new repository can encounter
problems because git has no knowledge about the connection between
the two.

If do not have a lot of local changes, the easiest way would be to
cherry-pick your changes to the new base:
```
% git checkout main
% git cherry-pick old_branch..your_branch
```
Or alternatively, you can do the same thing with rebase:
```
% git rebase --onto main master your_branch
```

If you do have a lot of changes, you would probably want to perform a
merge instead.  The idea is to create a merge point that consolidates
the history of the old_branch, and the new source of truth (main).

We intend to publish a set of pairs of SHA1s for this, but if you are
running a local conversion, you can find out by looking up the same
commit that are found on both parents:
```
% git show old_branch
```
You will see a commit message, now search for that in the new branch:
```
% git log --grep="commit message on old_branch" freebsd/main
```
You would get a SHA1 on the new main branch, create a helper branch
(in the example we call it 'stage') from that SHA1:
```
% git checkout -b stage SHA1_found_from_git_log
```
Then perform a merge of the old branch:
```
% git merge -s ours -m "Mark old branch as merged" old_branch
```
With that, it's possible to merge your work branch or the main branch
in any order without problem.  Eventually, when you are ready to commit
your work back to main, you can perform a rebase to main, or do a
squash commit by combining everything into one commit.
